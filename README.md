# Mixer_fixer
The project aims to create an efficient solution for blending beverages in the right proportion based on the user's preference and popular recipes, using the concepts of model based design. 

The Mixer Fixer device will have a touch interface that will allow users to select their desired drink, and the device will automatically dispense the precise amount of each component from its multiple canisters. 

Users can choose from a wide range of classic and unique drink combinations and even try out new and exciting ones suggested by the Mixer Fixer. 
This device is not only intended for professional bartenders but also for chemists and home enthusiasts, making it a perfect addition to any home.

The simulink file contains a simulation of the mixerfixer.
